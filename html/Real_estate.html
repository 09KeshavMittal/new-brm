            <p class="paragraph">
                Property development is a prominent market and one of the largest employers in the nation. In recent years, the enactment of the Real Estate (Regulation and
Development) Act, 2016, as amended from time to time, has changed the way in which builders and developers had been functioning over the years, by
putting accountability on their shoulders, thereby making real estate purchases by buyers transparent. Further, new revenue models have made real estate
players seek legal advice much more frequently than before.
</p>
