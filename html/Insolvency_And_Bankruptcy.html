            <p class="paragraph">
                Insolvencies and bankruptcies are unforeseeable circumstances that can leave a company, its internal systems, employees, shareholders and debtors in the
middle of a chaos, demanding for a settlement. Ever since its enactment, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 201 6, as amended from time to time (IBC), has
played a pivotal role in helping debtors recover their debts. Several debtors have sought legal expertise for representing themselves to get speedy justice and
settlement.
